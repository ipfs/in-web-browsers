# Objectives and Key Results

Quarterly statement of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for the "IPFS in Web Browsers" effort.

## Q1 2018 (WORK IN  PROGRESS)

- **Note:** This is work-in-progress document, not yet finalized. Please create PR against it with your own goals/proposals.
- **TODO:** Add your goals/proposals to the section below, as PRs :-)

**[IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion) is a solid foundation for browser integration(s) going forward:**

- Single codebase is running on all browsers (no forks, browser-specific modules are used instead)
- Robust CI/QA practices are established, improve test coverage ([ipfs-companion/#145](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/145))
- Up-to-date developer documentation exists
- IPFS is embeded into every browser page through window.ipfs
- Get one IPFS Web Application to learn how to use the IPFS Companion IPFS node if it is available (i.e PeerPad). Document the process..

**Improved initial experience for non-technical users of mainstream browsers:**

- Continuous presence in browser extension stores (pass/address reviews on time)
- Catering to less-technical users of Firefox or Chrome
  - Simplified and improved UX  ([ipfs-companion/#324](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/342) etc)
  - Display a Landing Page (user-focused primer on distributed web) after initial install ([ipfs-companion/#324](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-companion/issues/324))
  - UX without local go-ipfs node is improved under Firefox (eg. embedded js-ipfs is used for uploads, public gateway for downloads)

**[Brave](https://brave.com) is the first browser with "native" IPFS support:**

- IPFS connectivity working out-of-the-box in Brave
  - Embedded js-ipfs runs in Brave without installing external daemon
  - User experience is the same as in Firefox when running external node
- Support for native protocols in Location Bar and DOM elements (`href`, `src`)

**Structure documentation and discussion around the primary Browser vendor concerns:**

- `dweb:` proposal is documented
- `Ways to deal/support the Content Origin Policy for IPFS links` are documented
