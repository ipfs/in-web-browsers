# IPFS Integration in Web Browsers Working Group
[![#ipfs](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs) [![#ipfs-in-web-browsers](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-%23ipfs--in--web--browsers-brightgreen.svg)](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=ipfs-in-web-browsers)

> Tracking the Path to getting IPFS and other Decentralized Protocols Natively Supported in Web Browsers.

## Goals

- **Browser Users** - Browser extension exposes IPFS features in a robust and intuitive form
- **Web Developers** -  Ensure smooth experience for web developers in browser contexts
- **Browser Vendors** - Browser developers are addressing requirements of the distributed web

## Current Status

### Browser Extension

[IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#ipfs-companion) is a browser extension that simplifies access to IPFS resources and adds support for the
IPFS protocol.  
It runs in <img src="https://unpkg.com/@browser-logos/firefox@2.0.0/firefox_16x16.png" width="16" height="16">Firefox (desktop and android)
and various Chromium-based browsers such as
<img src="https://unpkg.com/@browser-logos/chrome@1.0.4/chrome_16x16.png" width="16" height="16">Chrome or
<img src="https://unpkg.com/@browser-logos/brave@3.0.0/brave_16x16.png" width="16" height="16">Brave.  
Check [its features](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#features) and [**install it**](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion#install) today!

##### Ongoing WebExtension Experiments
- [Exposing IPFS API via `window.ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/window.ipfs.md#notes-on-exposing-ipfs-api-as-windowipfs)
- [Mozilla hosts a community effort called `libdweb`](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb/) to implement experimental APIs for Firefox WebExtensions with a goal of enabling dweb protocols in Firefox through browser add-ons. [IPFS libdweb experiments](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/libdweb/docs/libdweb.md) include [native protocol handler](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/533), [local DNS-SD discovery and TCP transport](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/553). The long term goal of this project is to integrate these APIs into the WebExtensions ecosystem.
- [Support `chrome.sockets.*` APIs in Chromium browsers](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/664)

### JavaScript Ecosystem
Currently in order to run IPFS in a web browser, you have to either bundle [`js-ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs) (**full IPFS node in JS**) with your client-side application
or use [`js-ipfs-http-client`](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client) (**HTTP API client library**) to connect to external daemon running on local or remote machine. Make sure to check `/examples` in both repos.

#### ..in Service Workers

- Tracking related work: [#55](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/55)
  - Highlight: IPFS gateway fully running on a Service Worker [service-worker-gateway](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/service-worker-gateway)

### Accessing HTTP API

Standalone IPFS daemon (go-ipfs or js-ipfs in Node) exposes API at `/api/v0/`. 
It is an RPC-style API over HTTP POST.

- [Client libraries in various languages](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs#http-client-libraries)


### IPFS Addressing in Web Browsers

See  [this memo](ADDRESSING.md). It specifies current set of URL conventions for the IPFS community.    
We invite everyone to submit questions and suggestions for improvements via issues/PR.

#### DNSLink

DNSLink is mapping a domain name to an IPFS address by means of DNS TXT record. 

Read [DNSLink guide](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/concepts/dnslink/) for details such as setting it up on your own website and [DNSLink in IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/docs/dnslink.md) to see additional benefits of using our browser extension.

### Other Experiments

#### Signed HTTP Exchanges and WebPackage

Signed HTTP Exchanges (SXG) are experimental spec proposed by Google to decouple the origin of the content from who distributes it: [read more](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/121).

IPFS Gateway at `ipfs.io` participates in [Origin Trial for Signed HTTP Exchange (SXG)](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/11/signed-exchanges), starting with Google Chrome 71. This means [anyone can publish SXG](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/11/signed-exchanges#creating_your_sxg) on IPFS and regular Chrome can load it from our gateway without any additional setup on user side.
