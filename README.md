#### Notable past web extension experiments
- Mozilla hosted a community effort called [`libdweb`](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb/) to implement experimental APIs for Firefox WebExtensions, with a goal of enabling dweb protocols in Firefox through browser add-ons:
  - IPFS [libdweb experiments](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/libdweb/docs/libdweb.md), including a [native protocol handler](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/533), [local DNS-SD discovery and TCP transport](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/pull/553)
  - The long-term goal of this project was to integrate these APIs into the WebExtensions ecosystem, but as of Q3 2020 it is not yet in Firefox Nightly
- Exposing the IPFS API via [`window.ipfs`](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/companion-window-ipfs/) (experiment ended in 2020)
- Support for [`chrome.sockets.*` APIs](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/issues/664) in Chromium browsers (ended due to [EOL 2022](https://9to5google.com/2020/01/15/google-killing-chrome-apps/))

### IPFS and the JavaScript ecosystem

#### Helia 

[Helia](https://github.com/ipfs/helia) is a lean, modular, and modern TypeScript implementation of IPFS for the prolific JS and browser environments.

See the [Manifesto](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/wiki/Manifesto), the [FAQ](https://github.com/ipfs/helia/wiki/FAQ), and the [State of IPFS in JS blog post from October 2022](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/) for more info.

Usage examples:
- [examples at `ipfs/helia`](https://github.com/ipfs/helia?tab=readme-ov-file#-usage)
- an advanced, end-to-end example of using [`@helia/verified-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@helia/verified-fetch) node in `ServiceWorker` can be found at <https://inbrowser.link> ([sources](https://github.com/ipfs/service-worker-gateway/))

#### Legacy JS-IPFS

The `js-ipfs` / `ipfs-core` is is no longer maintained.
See [State of IPFS in JS blog post from October 2022](https://blog.ipfs.tech/state-of-ipfs-in-js/) for rationale.

### How to address IPFS on the web

- For regular users, see
  - this [guide to how to address IPFS content paths on the web](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/)
  - this [reference about HTTP Gateway API](https://docs.ipfs.tech/reference/http/gateway/)
- For browser vendors and user agent developers, see this [memo](ADDRESSING.md) for the current set of URL conventions for the IPFS community; we invite everyone to submit questions and suggestions for improvements via issues/PRs

### How to run own HTTP Gateway

- If you are a desktop user, try [IPFS Desktop](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/)
- If you only want to run a Gateway as a public HTTP server, and the data is provided by separate IPFS nodes, use the latest [Rainbow](https://github.com/ipfs/rainbow/), which is a specialized gateway daemon.
- If you want to host your own data and prefer to work with command-line, use the latest [Kubo daemon](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) and follow [gateway recipes](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/blob/master/docs/config.md#gateway-recipes).
- If you have a lot of data, consider running Kubo with [IPFS Cluster](https://ipfscluster.io/).

### How to implement HTTP Gateway

See specification and implementer notes at <https://specs.ipfs.tech/http-gateways/>.

#### DNSLink

[DNSLink](https://dnslink.dev) enables you to map a domain name to an IPFS address (CID or IPNS libp2p-key) by means of a DNS TXT record. 

- Read the [DNSLink guide](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/dnslink/) for details, including how to set it up on your own website 
- See details on [DNSLink in IPFS Companion](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/dnslink-companion/) to see additional benefits of using IPFS Companion with DNSLink support

### Collaborations

#### W3C

Protocol Labs is a [W3C Member](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List). 
Current focus is to watch, learn, and participate in [WebExtensions Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/webextensions/).

- 2023-Q3: [ServiceWorker-like protocol handlers for WebExtensions](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/212) mentioned during [WECG TPAC 2023 (notes)](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/_minutes/2023-09-11-wecg-tpac.md)

#### IPFS and Igalia collaborate on dweb in browsers

In 2020 IPFS and Igalia started a collaboration that continues to this day. 
Read more: https://blog.ipfs.tech/2021-01-15-ipfs-and-igalia-collaborate-on-dweb-in-browsers/  

The most notable highlights (chronological order):

* IPFS and [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/) started a collaboration that will continue beyond 2021+
* [Distributed web schemes have been safelisted in Chrome 86](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4776602869170176)â€™s implementation of [custom handlers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/system-state.html#custom-handlers) and [registered at IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml).
* Chrome 89 will allow browser extensions to register cross-origin handlers or handlers for schemes with prefix `ext+`. Refinement is pending for the [permission UI](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1079333).
* Firefox 84 marks `http://*.localhost/` URLs as [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which means websites loaded from local [subdomain gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/address-ipfs-on-web/#subdomain-gateway) will have access to the same Web APIs as HTTPS version.
* Firefox 84 has improved support for [loading locally delivered mixed-resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content#Loading_locally_delivered_mixed-resources). Patches have also been submitted to WebKit but are pending on reviews and discussions.
* Work is in progress to improve Chromiumâ€™s consistency and specification compliance regarding the notion of [secure contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/), including removing non-standard [localhost](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5698580851458048) [names](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5668106045227008).
* Miscellaneous other fixes have landed for the Firefox and Chromiumâ€™s implementations of custom handlers.
* WIP refactor to make it easier to register custom protocol handlers ([example](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2992306), related talk: [Integrating New Protocol Handlers into Chrome [BlinkOn 15]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHIN6FkLAS8))

#### Brave

- 2021: [Brave v1.19 has integrated IPFS into their desktop web browser](https://brave.com/brave-integrates-ipfs/) for Windows, macOS and Linux. 
  - When Brave detected an address which is an HTTP gateway URL to IPFS content or a native IPFS address such as `ipfs://` or `ipns://` it prompted the user to install and enable the native IPFS node (Kubo), or to use an HTTP gateway.  
  - Initial release (v1.19) was focused on daemon orchestration and on URI support (read [blogs and press](https://github.com/ipfs/in-web-browsers/issues/64#issuecomment-763016248))
- 2024: After over three years, the Brave team decided to remove support for running IPFS node as we could not find a mutually agreeable set of terms to make this integration sustainable.
  - Users can retain their PeerID and onboarded data by switching to IPFS Desktop + Companion extension. More details at [Migrating from Brave to IPFS Desktop](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2024-brave-migration-guide/).

#### ipfs-chromium

* 2023-Q3: Project introduction blogpost at [IPFS Multi-Gateway Experiment in Chromium](https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-05-multigateway-chromium-client/)
* 2023-Q3: [ipfs-chromium](https://github.com/little-bear-labs/ipfs-chromium) project ships first builds
